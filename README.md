# Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser

This repository contains our term project on the **Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment**, based on the landmark work of Kim et al. (1999). The project studies how quantum entanglement and measurement choices determine whether photons display wave-like or particle-like behavior, even when the “choice” is made after detection.

The full report and derivations are provided in the project PDF included in this repository.

## Overview

The delayed choice quantum eraser is a refinement of the double-slit experiment that shows:
- Interference depends on the *availability of which-path information*, not on any physical disturbance.
- Entangled photons allow interference patterns to be recovered or destroyed through coincidence measurements.
- The behavior of a quantum system cannot be said to be fixed “in advance” of measurement.

This experiment directly probes the foundations of quantum mechanics, complementarity, and the role of information.

## Topics Covered

- Wave–particle duality and Bohr’s complementarity  
- Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment  
- Quantum eraser concept and which-path information  
- Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) and entangled photons  
- Beam splitters, interferometers, and polarization optics  
- Coincidence detection and Glauber’s formalism  
- Analytical derivation of detection rates  
- Emergence of interference in conditional measurements  

## Key Results

- Coincidences with detectors that **erase which-path information** show interference fringes.
- Coincidences with detectors that **preserve which-path information** show no interference.
- The interference pattern is not visible in single-photon counts but only in correlated measurements.
- Measurement and information, not classical causality, govern observed quantum behavior.

## Structure of the Repository

- `Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser.pdf` – Full project report with theory, derivations, and results  
- Figures and plots showing coincidence rates and interference patterns  
- Supporting notes and calculations  

## Motivation

This project was done to develop a deeper conceptual and mathematical understanding of:
- How quantum measurement works  
- Why entanglement is central to modern quantum mechanics  
- How “delayed choice” experiments challenge classical intuition about time and causality  

The work connects formal quantum optics with foundational questions about reality, information, and observation.
